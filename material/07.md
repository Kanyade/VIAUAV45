# Chapter 7: Persistent data storage

We've seen how we can handle data in apps involving user input and network communication in the previous chapters.

While many apps depend solely on network communication and memory caching, there are use-cases where local data storage - as in, storing data persistently on the device our app is running on - has to be implemented. Such use-cases could be as simple as storing the user's settings and as large and complex as supporting full-, or semi-offline features, including synchronizing local changes with a backend.

Let's take one step back to the basics. In this chapter, we'll look at persistent data storage options available in Flutter, including file handling, key-value stores, and relational databases.

## File operations

The project we'll be looking at here is the image_downloader sample app.

The app can save random images from Picsum as files into a specific directory on the filesystem and display the downloaded images in a grid. The app is designed to work on Android and iOS.

> We only have one GET network request for retrieving images in this simple app. We don't use the higher-level libraries discussed in chapter 6. This approach is, in fact, perfectly fine for prototyping and small projects.

### path and path_provider

While handling file and directory paths may seem like a basic task on modern frameworks, doing so in a cross-platform manner has many challenges. Just think about different path separator characters or dedicated folders on each platform. 

Fortunately, the Flutter platform team provides some packages to help us overcome this complexity with ease.

The [path](https://pub.dev/packages/path) package provides top-level functions for manipulating file system paths, like `join()` and `split()`.  After adding *path* to the project's *pubspec.yaml* file as a dependency, we can import it with a prefix in any *.dart* file to start using the provided functions.

```dart
import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;
```

With that import in place, we can use *path* like this (example taken from *image_downloader*'s main.dart):

```dart
path.join(directory.path, IMAGES_DIR))
```

The [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) package, on the other hand, gives us functions that can return paths to specific, dedicated folders on the supported platforms. We can add *path_provider* to a project the same way as we added *path*. 

We can find an example for using one of path_provider's methods - `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` - in the `_getImageDirectory()` function of `_ImageDownloaderPageState`.

```dart
Future<Directory> _getImagesDirectory() async {
  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory(); // <- Here
  return Directory(path.join(directory.path, IMAGES_DIR)).create();
}
```

`getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`  returns platform-specific directory paths:

- On iOS, it uses the `NSDocumentDirectory` API to get the folder where the current app may place user-generated data.
- On Android, it uses `Context.getDataDirectory()` to get the app's own private data storage folder.
- On other platforms, this method throws a `MissingPlatformDirectoryException`.

Some other path_provider functions to check out:

- `getApplicationSupportDirectory()`
- `getDownloadsDirectory()` 

> For demonstration purposes, we use a simple import for path_provider and we call `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` without a prefix. However, we could import path_provider.dart with an alias and use its functions with a prefix as we did with path.

There's one more thing to discuss that makes image_downloader tick, and that's classes from the `dart:io` package. Like in most programming languages, `File` in Dart is a reference to a file on a file system with the ability to manipulate the referenced file. The same applies to the `Directory` class and directories.

With this knowledge in our pockets, let's take a look at `_ImageDownloaderPageState`'s three functions that drive the *image_loader* app.

First of all, `_getImageDirectory()` is responsible for creating a `Directory` object that references the directory we'll be storing the downloaded images in and also from where we'll be loading them to be shown on the UI. 

```dart
Future<Directory> _getImagesDirectory() async {
  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  return Directory(path.join(directory.path, IMAGES_DIR)).create();
}
```

The `_downloadNewImage()` function is responsible for downloading a new random image from Picsum, storing it under a random name (a generated UUID + ".jpg"), and refreshing the UI state afterward.

```dart
Future<void> _downloadNewImage() async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse("https://picsum.photos/400")); // Query the image
  final imagesDir = await _getImagesDirectory(); // Get the target directory
  final filePath = path.join(  // Create the absolute path the file will be saved to
    imagesDir.path,
    "${uuidGenerator.v4().toString()}.jpg",
  );
  final file = File(filePath); // Create a File object for file handling
  await file.writeAsBytes(response.bodyBytes); // Write the bytes of the image to the file
  print("Image downloaded to: $filePath");
  setState(() {
    _imageFiles = _loadImages(); // Refresh the state
  });
}
```

> Note that we've changed the file naming scheme compared to what was seen in the lecture, as that implementation didn't guarantee to generate unique file names on each call. Now we use the [uuid](https://pub.dev/packages/uuid) package to generate random UUIDs for file names.

Last but not least, there's the `_loadImages()` function that returns a `Future<List<File>>` object containing a list of references to the downloaded image files.

```dart
Future<List<File>> _loadImages() async {
  final imagesDir = await _getImagesDirectory();
  return imagesDir
      .list() // Lists immediate subdirectories and files
      .where((element) => element.path.endsWith(".jpg")) // Filter for JPG files
      .map((e) => File(e.path)) // Map FileSystemEntity objects to File objects
      .toList(); // Convert resulting Iterable<File> to List<File>
}
```

> Note that we use the same asynchronous data loading logic with `FutureBuilder` as we did in chapter 6. Namely, storing a `Future` reference in a `StatefulWidget`'s state and passing that reference to a `FutureBuilder` in the `build()` method.
