# Accessibility and responsive UI support on Flutter

In the previous chapters we've learnt how should we implement a Flutter application for ourself, for our devices in our prefered language. We have only one problem with that: 
Luckily not only we will use it. Others will use it as well if we support accessibility. 

## Accessibility
TODO

### Internationalization and localization
If the app might be deployed to users who speak another language then we have to internationalise it. That means we develop the app in a way that makes it possible to localise values like text and layouts for each language that the app supports.
TODO

- `a11y`
- `i18n`
- `l10n`

[intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package


### RTL support
`textDirection`

### Text-to-Speech 
`semanticLabel`


## Responsive UI
Once we need to support multiple platforms with different sizes and factors, we'll need to learn about responsive layouts and how to deal with them in Flutter.
### SizedBox vs. FittedBox
TODO
### Wrap
TODO
### Layoutbuilder vs. MediaQuery
The main difference with the [MediaQuery](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQuery-class.html) always provides the size of the full application, info about the physical screen. While [Layoutbuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html) actually takes only the current parent size.

TODO sample: Wrap the MediaQuery into a sizeconfig like the [flutter_screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) package and use it.
