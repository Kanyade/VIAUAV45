# Chapter 8: Backend as a Service (BaaS), Firebase, FlutterFire

## What's BaaS?

Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model where all of the web and/or mobile apps' backed services are outsourced to a service provider. BaaS providers deliver and maintain all APIs needed to use their services.

## What's Firebase?

Firebase is Google's BaaS platform. It provides many pre-built services, including:

- Authentication
- File storage (Storage)
- Database (Firestore, Realtime Database)
    - NoSQL, collection and document based
- Crash reporting (Crashlytics)
- Analytics
- etc.

## FlutterFire

(Rt Database has no Web support, but use Firestore instead!)
Crashlytics has no Web support :(


### Firestore

https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/usage/

dispose - we're using StreamBuilders, so there's no need to manually dispose the subscriptions

### Analytics
