# Essential Flutter Widgets

In the previous chapters we've gotten familiar with Dart and the basic structure of a starter Flutter project.

Now we'll take a look at some fundamental widgets that you'll encounter in most Flutter projects along with basic layouts and UI elements.

> To start each example from the [chapter's demo project], use the `flutter run -t lib/main.dart` command, changing `main.dart` to the file you want to be the entry point of the app.
