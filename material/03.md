# Essential Flutter Widgets

In the previous chapters we've gotten familiar with Dart and the basic structure of a starter Flutter project.

Now we'll take a look at some fundamental widgets that you'll encounter in most Flutter projects along with basic layouts and UI elements.

> To start each example from the [chapter's demo project](/projects/chapters/chapter_03), use the `flutter run -t lib/main.dart` command, changing `main.dart` to the file you want to be the entry point of the app.
> In Android Studio, you can create launch configs for each entry point file.

## The App Widgets

While we definitely *could* build every aspect of a Flutter app ourselves from the ground up, it doesn't mean we really *should* go down on that path.

The [`WidgetsApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsApp-class.html) widget is there to provide basic functionality for apps.

By making a `WidgetsApp` the top level widget in our app's widget tree, it makes implementing the following functionalities really straight-forward:

- Defining the default text style for every widget in the app
- Handling localization
- Navigation between pages (screens)
- Handling overlays, like dialogs that can be displayed over other content

`WidgetsApp` seems to be a class with a lot of responsibilities, but under the hood it delegates these responsibilities to other widgets, like [`DefaultTextStyle`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DefaultTextStyle-class.html), or [`Navigator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html).  

If our goal was to build a game, or a regular app with our own design language, `WidgetsApp` pretty much has us covered.

However, Flutter has built-in support for [Material Design](https://material.io/), Google's all-around design language, and even for Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/). Flutter's implementation of the latter is called Cupertino.
