# Chapter 5: Material widgets, advanced widgets, navigation, animation

> **"BREAKING" NEWS**: As of *2021.03.03.* (the [Flutter Engage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yll3SNXvQCw) event), Flutter 2 hit stable status along with Dart 2.12.0. We strongly recommend updating and using these new versions from now on. We were preparing for this right from the start of the course, so this may not be a large overhead.
> 
> To switch to the stable channel of the Flutter SDK and start using Flutter 2 and Dart 2.12.0, run the `flutter channel stable` console command followed by `flutter upgrade`.
